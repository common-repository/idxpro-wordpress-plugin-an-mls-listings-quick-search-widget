IDXPro is an MLS Search Application. It's designed to blend seamlessly into your website. Try it for free!

== Description ==

IDXPro is an MLS Search Application.
Check out our [IDXPro Website](http://idxpro.com).

IDX (Internet Data Exchange) enables real estate professionals to display properties from their MLS boards on their personal websites.
IDXPro is branded with your photo, logo and contact information so that when visitors search for homes, they will turn to you for help.
It has several search options including Quick Search, Advanced Search, Map Search, and Foreclosures.
It has built-in tools for capturing and tracking leads: teaser visitor registration and a custom contact form.
We also added Quick Search, Listing Slideshow, Google Map, Popular Searches, MLS#, and Custom Form widgets that you can add to your sidebar.

We like to keep things simple for you. IDXPro is configured to work right out of the box. 
Our fluid layouts automatically resize themselves to fit whatever space you put them in. 
Even the height of the frame expands to fit the contents of the search pages. 
Are you familiar with those double scroll bars that plague so many iframed idx solutions? Kiss them goodbye.
IDXPro is the simplest IDX WordPress solution to deploy on a WordPress site.
You can easily choose custom colors to make it look like a seamless part of your website.

Even without the plugin, IDXPro is compatible with any website.
